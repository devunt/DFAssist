## **<span style="color:red;">This fork is no more maintained!</span>**  
SE is changing opcodes in every patches, even in hot-fix patches. They are intentionally bothering maintaining 3rd-party applications. This is why I stopped maintaining this. You might find some other forks working.

## patch 5.2 update
After v5.2 patch, SE does not send matched duty of roulette. So, there is no 3rd party app which shows you matched duty of roulette.
